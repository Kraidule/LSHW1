<!-- Test for constructive code class, example was given as homework and we were tasked to replicate it ourselves in code
at first it was confusing but with some basic research in positioning and generation with CSS code, it became self explanatory,
with this first piece of homework, I have now learned a few essential basics on how to code and can now apply it to other assignments. -->
